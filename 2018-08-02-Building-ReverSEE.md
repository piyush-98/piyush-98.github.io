## Building ReverSEE

This post aims to cover the developement process of [ReverSEE](https://github.com/arush15june/reversee), a reverse image search hoopla i built to essentialy learn to use PyTorch.

# a silly idea

<popular indian fashion website> allows you to throw a picture of a random tshirt in their search bar and they'll find you how a similar tshirt available in the store. 

**Idea**: How could i go about building something similar of my own? Perfect oppurtunity to learn to use PyTorch 0.4.0, recently released on Windows, where with accidental CUDA 9.1 drivers, Tensorflow wouldn't run without building it from source, a task i refused.
