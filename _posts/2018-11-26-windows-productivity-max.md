title: Making Windows 10 Usable.

## Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.

_I use Arch btw_
But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.



### Some Points

- Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567).
- I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).
- My HDMI Monitor work without problems.
- My NVIDIA GPU works, both for PyTorch and Gaming.
- good battery life, though, using bumblebee on linux makes battery life good on linux too.
