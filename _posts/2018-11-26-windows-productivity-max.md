## Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.

_I use Arch btw_
But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.

### Some Points

- Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567).
- I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).
- My HDMI Monitor work without problems.
- My NVIDIA GPU works, both for PyTorch and Gaming.
- good battery life, though, using bumblebee on linux makes battery life just as good, if not better, on linux too.

### My Setup

I use Windows 10 Home Edition, which came preinstalled on 

### Improve Windows!

These are some things I believe would help improve your experience on Windows.

- Decrease scaling.

- Get bash back.

- Better Command Line and terminals!

Yes, everyone loves their terminals, but using the default CMD prompt, Powershell or even the WSL Shell on Windows, is, _unpleasant_.
