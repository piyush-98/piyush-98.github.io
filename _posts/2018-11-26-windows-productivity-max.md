title: Making Windows 10 Usable.
---
## Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.

_I use Arch btw_
But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.

### Some Points

- Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567).
- I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).
- My HDMI Monitor work without problems.
- My NVIDIA GPU works, both for PyTorch and Gaming.
- good battery life, though, using bumblebee on linux makes battery life just as good, if not better, on linux too.

### My Setup

I use Windows 10 Home Edition, which came preinstalled on my Dell 7567 dual booting with AntergOS runnning KDE Plasma 5. A Monitor (Dell S2240L) connected to my laptop and keep it on power most of the time, which imo I should stop doing and make sure its getting proper charge and discharge cycles. Connecting it to an external keyboard and mouse essentially makes it a `Dual Monitor Gaming PC B|` setup. Instead of having my Laptop's screen as the primary monitor, switching to the bigger 21inch monitor as the primary screen makes it very useful, for both working and playing games.

### Improve Windows!

These are some things I believe would help improve your experience on Windows.

- **Enable Dark Mode.**

- **Decrease scaling.**

On a 1080p on both my laptop and the external monitor, the default 125% scaling option is just harsh, and well, very big. I believe decreasing it to 100% makes it much more bearable and makes the system look less cluttered.

- Right click on the desktop and Select `Display Settings` at the end of the list.

- Change the scaling to 100%.

- **Get bash back.**

- **Better Command Line and terminals with Cmder!**

Yes, everyone loves their terminals, but using the default CMD prompt, Powershell or even the WSL Shell on Windows, is, _unpleasant_.

- Workspaces Good.
