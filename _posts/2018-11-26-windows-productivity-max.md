title: Making Windows 10 Usable.
---
## Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.

_I use Arch btw_
But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.

### Some Points

- Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567).
- I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).
- My HDMI Monitor work without problems.
- My NVIDIA GPU works, both for PyTorch and Gaming.
- good battery life, though, using bumblebee on linux makes battery life just as good, if not better, on linux too.

### My Setup

I use Windows 10 Home Edition, which came preinstalled on my Dell 7567 dual booting with AntergOS runnning KDE Plasma 5. A Monitor (Dell S2240L) connected to my laptop and keep it on power most of the time, which imo I should stop doing and make sure its getting proper charge and discharge cycles. Connecting it to an external keyboard and mouse essentially makes it a `Dual Monitor Gaming PC B|` setup. Instead of having my Laptop's screen as the primary monitor, switching to the bigger 21inch monitor as the primary screen makes it very useful, for both working and playing games.

### Improve Windows!

These are some things I believe would help improve your experience on Windows.

- **Enable Dark Mode.**

Not really the dark mode you wanted, still, better than nothing. 

- Go to `Settings->Personalization->Colors`

- Scroll to the botom and select dark mode.

This does not the turn the windows explorer to dark, but atleast makes the system settings dark and windows store dark (and maybe more apps i dont know of).

- **Decrease scaling.**

On a 1080p on both my laptop and the external monitor, the default 125% scaling option is just harsh, and well, very big. I believe decreasing it to 100% makes it much more bearable and makes the system look less cluttered.

- Right click on the desktop and Select `Display Settings` at the end of the list.

- Change the scaling to 100%.

- **Smaller Taskbar Buttons**

The taskbar is uuuge, by default. Change this to smaller taskbar buttons and enjoy that space in your taskbar.

- Go to `Settings->Personalization->Taskbar`

- Swipe the button titled `Use Small Taskbar Buttons`

- **Get bash back.**

Install the magical Windows Subsytem for Linux on your Windows 10 machine right now! Get most of what a Linux distribution can do right on your Windows machine without a heavy VM.

- Go to the Microsoft Store. (Search `Store` in the Searhc bar)

- Search for `WSL` to get all your option of OS'es listed, which include vanilla Debian, Kali Linux and Ubuntu. yep, the famous kali lincox right on windows.

- Install any of them and follow the simple process to setup your user on it. With the included terminal you can access the beautiful subsystem, but its meh, really.

- **Better Command Line and terminals with Cmder!**

Yes, everyone loves their terminals, but using the default CMD prompt, Powershell or even the WSL Shell on Windows, is, _unpleasant_.

- **Workspaces Good.**


## What's missing?
