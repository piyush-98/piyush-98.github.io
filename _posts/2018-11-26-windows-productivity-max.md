title: Making Windows 10 Usable.

## Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.

_I use Arch btw_
But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.

### Some Points

- Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567).
- I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).
- My HDMI Monitor work without problems.
- My NVIDIA GPU works, both for PyTorch and Gaming.
- good battery life, though, using bumblebee on linux makes battery life just as good, if not better, on linux too.

### My Setup


### Improve Windows!

These are some things I believe would help improve your experience on Windows.

- **Decrease scaling.**

On a 1080p display on both my laptop's display and the external monitor, the default 125% scaling option is just harsh, and well, very big. I believe decreasing it to 100% makes it much more bearable and makes the system look more uncluttered.

- Right click on the desktop and Select `Display Settings` at the end of the list.

- **Get bash back.**

- **Better Command Line and terminals!**

Yes, everyone loves their terminals, but using the default CMD prompt, Powershell or even the WSL Shell on Windows, is, _unpleasant_.


- Workspaces Good.
