## Signature Recognition
The post is written about an AI model which can predict the frorgery and  genuinity of a Signature sample . <br>

## Problem Statement
In organisations like banks where the Authenticity of the signature of a person is very important , there still doesn't exist any autonomous system which can predict frorgery of a signature .

`Artificial Intelligence` is the field of computer science that emphasizes on creating intelligent systems and through which
a machine can learn making decisions , I have been working in this field for a while ,so i decided to solve this problem with the help of some knowledge that i have been able gain in past few years.

## The Idea



In organisations like banks , they basically have the database of every customer hence i made my model accordingly .
So let's dive into the techincalities now .
### Dataset ---
I used various Online datasets available for the model . The idea was to having number of samples of every of person/customer including genuine as well as frorged signatures to make a `person dependent system`.
luckily i found various online datasets of the same manner online.I used dutch as well as english signatures so as to increase the dataset .
