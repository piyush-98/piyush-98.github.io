## Signature Recognition
The post is written about an AI model which can predict the frorgery and  genuinity of a Signature sample . <br>

## Problem Statement
In organisations like banks where the Authenticity of the signature of a person is very important , there still doesn't exist any autonomous system which can predict frorgery of a signature .

Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science that emphasizes on creating intelligent systems and through which
a machine can learn making decisions , I have been working in this field for a while ,so i decided to solve this problem with the help of some knowledge that i have been able gain in past few years.
